  abstract = {A local symmetric weak form (LSWF) for linear potential problems is developed, and a truly meshless method, based on the LSWF and the moving least squares approximation, is presented for solving potential problems with high accuracy. The essential boundary conditions in the present formulation are imposed by a penalty method. The present method does not need a ``\AE nite element mesh'', either for purposes of interpolation of the solution variables, or for the integration of the ``energy''. All integrals can be easily evaluated over regularly shaped domains (in general, spheres in three-dimensional problems) and their boundaries. No post-smoothing technique is required for computing the derivatives of the unknown variable, since the original solution, using the moving least squares approximation, is already smooth enough. Several numerical examples are presented in the paper. In the example problems dealing with Laplace \& Poisson's equations, high rates of convergence with mesh re\AE nement for the Sobolev norms jj jj0 and jj jj1 have been found, and the values of the unknown variable and its derivatives are quite accurate. In essence, the present meshless method based on the LSWF is found to be a simple, ef\AE cient, and attractive method with a great potential in engineering applications.},

If the beam is very thin, there can be shear locking and the numerical approximation leads to erroneous solutions. In this work, shear locking is analyzed by calculating expressly the curves of the transverse deflection, the cross-section rotation, and the shear strain in different approaches. The influence of the ratio between the shear stiffness and the bending stiffness is explicitly shown when force and moment loads are applied. It is concluded that the locking behavior at nodes is not the decisive factor to assess the quality of the solution. The important point is to analyze the entire curves when the ratio between the stiffnesses is varied. It is verified that the mixed interpolation and the discrete shear gap approaches are superior to the pure displacement and to the field consistency approaches.},

We investigate the use of higher order NURBS to address static straight and curved Timoshenko beam with several approaches usually used in standard locking free finite elements. Among theses methods, two main new strategies have been developed for NURBS: selective reduced integration and B projection method. Although the simplicity of implementation and the low computational cost suggest that the first method is attractive, this approach is difficult to be generalized to arbitrary polynomial order and continuity. Conversely, the B one offers a global formalism suitable to tackle every NURBS problem and appears then as the most serious concurrent. The resulting NURBS B element, which happens to be equivalent to a NURBS mixed element, provides robust and accurate results. The performance of the two methods is assessed on several numerical examples, and comparisons are made with other published techniques to prove their effectiveness.},

A single layer of elements is considered through the thickness of the shell, and the degree of approximation in that direction is chosen to be equal to two. A full 3D constitutive relation is assumed. The objective is to obtain highly accurate low-degree elements to be used in coarse meshes. In order to do that, we propose a mixed method from which we derive a B-projection to deal with locking. The main idea is to modify the interpolation of the average stresses and strains through the thickness. More precisely, we develop two finite elements. The first element, which is based on the mixed method or, equivalently, on the B-projection, is extremely accurate, but leads to a fully-populated global stiffness matrix. To improve the efficiency, the second element uses a local least-squares-type procedure to define a new B-projection, leading to a sparse global stiffness matrix. The quality and efficiency of the methods are assessed through several usual test cases and by comparison with other published techniques.},

Here we present a reduced degree of basis functions for the additional fields of the stress resultants and strains of the beam, which are allowed to be discontinuous across elements. This approach turns out to significantly improve the computational efficiency and the accuracy of the results. We consider a beam formulation with extensible directors, where cross-sectional strains are enriched to avoid Poisson locking by an enhanced assumed strain method. In numerical examples, we show the superior per degree-of-freedom accuracy of IGA over conventional finite element analysis, due to the higher order continuity in the displacement field.

In this work we present an efficient mixed formulation for avoiding membrane locking of curved non-polar plane rods in the context of isogeometric analysis. An efficient spline reconstruction of the assumed axial strains obtained by means of a local projection at the element level is performed using the method proposed by Thomas et al. in [26] for the reconstruction of the geometry. In this way a much smaller bandwidth of the stiffness matrix is obtained with respect to the non local B\textasciimacron -formulation, with significant reduction of the computational cost. The blended mixed formulation splits in two steps: in the first step the local B\textasciimacron{} operators are defined at the element level via projection of the strain measure (both L2-projection and discrete collocation approaches are considered). Successively, by means of the spline reconstruction algorithm, the global projection of the strain measures at the patch level is defined. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method, in addition to completely remove membrane locking, yields the same accuracy and rate of convergence as the non local B\textasciimacron -method.},

The discrete governing equations as well as the boundary conditions in strong form for the three-dimensional beam are then derived by using the conservation conditions and the CSPM interpolation function. The developed model enables one to expediently discretize the geometric nonlinear beam with only a row of particles at the central axis and to automatically satisfy the free boundary condition without any additional treatment. Moreover, Lagrangian kernel function and stress points are adopted to eliminate tensile instability and instability induced by the rank deficiency within the particle methods.

To improve the prediction accuracy, the conventional SPH method is improved by the symmetric SPH method starting from the Taylor series expansion. Moreover, the neutral surface position of the bi-directional FG beam is determined and the third order Reddy-Bickford beam theory based on this exact neutral surface is adopted. The governing equations are deduced for FGB composed by two or four different materials and then discretized by the proposed method.

  abstract = {This work proposes a novel Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) extension of the assumed natural strain (ANS) method to alleviate locking phenomena in solid beams, which are modeled as 3D elements accounting for displacement degrees of freedom solely and designed such that accurate analyses can be generally obtained using only one element to discretize the structure's crosssection. ANS methods substitute covariant compatible strains that cause locking in solid beams, when, e.g., constrained to be thin, with a so-called assumed strain field. Namely, the compatible strains are interpolated at suitable locations, termed tying points, and the assumed strains are then derived using an ad hoc element-based extrapolation. This local operation involves, in principle, the inversion of extrapolation matrices; yet, these quantities can be computed at once and in closed form, using a linear extrapolation in the quadratic case, without needing any inversion operation. The introduced IGA ANS technique, specifically tailored to mitigate membrane and shear locking, given the superior geometric approximation provided by the adopted IGA framework, as well as the high regularity of the utilized computer-aided design basis functions, is also able to naturally alleviate thickness and curvature-thickness locking phenomena and its effectiveness is proven through extensive numerical testing.},

  abstract = {An equal-order strain projection (EOSP) method is proposed to effectively address the shear and membrane locking for isogeometric analysis of shear deformable curved beams in the context of B-bar formulation. The key feature of EOSP is the projection of membrane and shear strains based upon a set of new basis functions which shares the same smoothness as the basis functions for displacement approximation. This set of EOSP basis functions is readily constructed through a basis transformation of the displacement basis functions, where the transformation coefficients are attained by evaluating the displacement basis functions at the one-order lower Greville points. It is shown that the EOSP basis functions preserve certain desirable properties such as compactness, non-negativity and partition of unity. The resulting isogeometric formulation with EOSP not only successfully eliminates the shear and membrane locking, but also substantially improves the accuracy of membrane and shear strain solutions compared with the B-bar formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed EOSP is thoroughly demonstrated by both static and free vibration analysis results of several benchmark problems.},

To resolve shear locking in meshfree formulation of Mindlin--Reissner plates, the following two issues are addressed: (1) construction of approximation functions capable of reproducing Kirchhoff modes, and (2) formulation of domain integration of Galerkin weak form capable of producing exact solution under pure bending condition. In this study, we first identify the Kirchhoff mode reproducing conditions (KMRC), and show that the employment of a second order monomial basis in the reproducing kernel or moving least-square approximation of translational and rotational degrees of freedom is an effective means to meet KMRC. Next, the integration constraints that fulfill bending exactness (BE) in the Galerkin meshfree discretization of Mindlin--Reissner plate are derived. A nodal integration with curvature smoothing stabilization that fulfills BE is then formulated for Mindlin--Reissner plate. The curvature smoothing stabilization is introduced in the nodally integrated Galerkin weak form. The resulting meshfree formulation is stable and free of shear locking in the limit of thin plate. Both computational efficiency and accuracy are achieved in the proposed meshfree Mindlin--Reissner plate formulation.},

The shear locking is avoided by introducing an interior node to the element and adopting two-node Hermitian interpolation functions for transverse displacements and torsional rotation and three-node Lagrangian interpolation functions for the flexural rotations and warping function. Several examples are analyzed to validate the accuracy and convergent efficiency of the proposed beam element, and the results are compared with theoretical and numerical solutions.

In particular, the global B projection method and a mixed formulation are examined and compared, showing equivalently optimal convergence with regard to displacement solutions. These two formulations are proved to be equal when the beam cross-sectional properties are uniform. For beams with non-uniform cross-sectional properties, the mixed formulation is superior in terms of stress recovery. In addition to these two methods, an alternative locking-free formulation, a C0 NURBS element with selectively reduced integration is suggested in this study, making use of the traditional selective reduced integration (SRI) rule designed for Lagrangian elements. This SRI C0 NURBS element is simple to implement, preserves the sparsity of the global stiffness matrix and requires fewer quadrature point evaluations. Most importantly, due to the use of NURBS basis functions, the exact curve geometry is preserved with all three locking-free isogeometric elements. Benchmark problems and illustrative examples with complex curved geometries are examined for a detailed investigation of the considered locking-free elements.},
